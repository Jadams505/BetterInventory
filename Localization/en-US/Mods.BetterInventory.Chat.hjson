	As I could not replicate the freeze when picking up an item, I am not sure if it is fixed.
    [c/ff0000:If you still encounter this bug, please report it!] Setting {$Mods.BetterInventory.Configs.InventoryManagement.autoEquip.Name} to {$Mods.BetterInventory.Configs.AutoEquipLevel.Off.Label} should temporarily solve it.
